# explore_us_bikeshare_data
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.We have write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We have also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
